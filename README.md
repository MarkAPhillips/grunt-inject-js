# grunt-inject-js v.0.1.0

> Grunt task that allows for multiple js files to injected into a file. Inspired by [grunt-inject](https://github.com/ChrisWren/grunt-inject)

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-inject-js --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-inject-js');
```

## The inject_js task

### Overview
_Run this task with the `grunt inject_js` command._

Task targets, files and options may be specified according to the Grunt [Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.

The task is to allow for the injection of multiple javascript scripts into a document at defined places in the document. The use case arose when having to inject different third party
analytics code at different locations.


```js
grunt.initConfig({
   inject_js: {
       dev:
        {
          files:{
            'test/output/index.html': 'test/fixtures/index.html'
          },
          scriptsrc: 'test/fixtures/*.js'
        }
      },
});
```

### Required properties

#### scriptsrc
Type: `String` || `Array` || [file glob](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#globbing-patterns)

The path of the script(s) to be injected into the page.

It is recommended to have a directory that includes all the JavaScript files to be injected.
A warning is raised if the directory contains non-JavaScript files.

#### files
Type: [`Grunt file configuration`](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#files)

The `src` HTML files must have the following comment(s) which are replaced by the injected JavaScript:

```html
<!-- inject:[jsfile] -->
```

where ```[jsfile]``` is the JavaScript file name to be injected. The file extension .js should be omitted.

The follow configuration would inject three files into the html document at the specified locations:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head lang="en">
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Grunt Inject JS Test file</title>
    <!-- inject:google -->
    <!-- inject:woopra -->
</head>
<body>
<h1>Test File</h1>
<p>
    Content of test file
</p>
<!-- inject:pardot -->
</body>
</html>
```
